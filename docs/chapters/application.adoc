## The Micro-Trader Application

Now that we know more about Vert.x and microservices, it's time to discuss the application we are going to develop
in this lab.

It's going to be a fake financial app, where we will be making (virtual) money. The application is composed of a set of
microservices:

* The quote generator - this is an absolutely unrealistic simulator that generates the quotes for 3 fictional companies _MacroHard_, _Divinator_, and _Black Coat_. The market data is published on the Vert.x event bus.

* The traders - these are a set of components that receives quotes from the quote generator and decides whether or not to buy or sell a particular share. To make this decision, they rely on another component called the _portfolio_ service.

* The portfolio - this service manages the number of shares in our portfolio and their monetary value. It is exposed as a _service proxy_, i.e. an asynchronous RPC service on top of the Vert.x event bus. For every successful operation, it sends a message on the event bus describing the operation. It uses the quote generator to evaluate the current value of the portfolio.

* The audit - that's the legal side, you know... We need to keep a list of all our operations (yes, that's the law). The
audit component receives operations from the portfolio service via an event bus and address . It then stores theses in a database. It also provides a REST endpoint to retrieve the latest set of operations.

* The dashboard - some UI to let us know when we become rich.

Let's have a look at the architecture:

The application uses several types of services:

* HTTP endpoint (_i.e._ REST API) - this service is located using an HTTP URL.
* Service proxies - these are asynchronous services exposed on the event bus using an RPC interaction mechanism, the service is
located using an (event bus) address.
* Message sources - these are components publishing messages on the event bus, the service is located using an (event bus)
address.

These components runs in the same network (in this lab they will be on the same machine, but in different
processes).

The dashboard presents the available services, the value of each company's quotes, the latest set of operations made by our
traders and the current state of our portfolio. It also shows the state of the different circuit breakers.

We are going to implement critical parts of this application. However, the rest of the code is provided to illustrate some
other Vert.x features. The code that needs to be written by us is indicated using **TODO** and wrapped as follows:
