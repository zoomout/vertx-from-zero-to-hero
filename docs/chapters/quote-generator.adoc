## The first microservice - the quote generator

Disclaimer, the quote generator is unrealistic, and is basically a set of randoms...

### Project structure

Let's have a look to the project, as every other project are structured the same way.

----

Let's start with the `pom.xml` file. This file specifies the Maven build:

1. Define the dependencies
2. Compile the java code and process resources (if any)
3. Build a _fat-jar_

A _fat-jar_ (also called _uber_ jar or _shaded_ jar) is a convenient way to package a Vert.x application. It creates a
_über-jar_ containing your application and all its dependencies, including Vert.x. Then, to launch it, you just need
to use `java -jar ....`, without having to handle the `CLASSPATH`. Wait, I told you that Vert.x does not dictate a
type of packaging. It's true, fat jars are convenient, but it's not the only way, you can use plain (not fat) jars,
OSGi bundles...

The created _fat-jar_ is configured to use a main class provided in `vertx-workshop-common` (`io.vertx.workshop
.common.Launcher`). This `Launcher` class creates the Vert.x instance, configure it and deploys the _main-verticle_.
Again, it's just a convenient way, you can use your own _main_ class.

### Verticle

As you may have noticed, the code is structured in 3 `verticles`, but what are these? Verticles is a way to structure
 Vert.x application code. It's not mandatory, but it is quite convenient. A verticle is a chunk of code that is
 deployed on top of a Vert.x instance. A verticle has access to the instance of `vertx` on which it's deployed, and
 can deploy other verticles.

Let's open the `GeneratorConfigVerticle` class, and look at the `start` method:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public void start() {
    super.start();

    JsonArray quotes = config().getJsonArray("companies");
    for (Object q : quotes) {
      JsonObject company = (JsonObject) q;
      // Deploy the verticle with a configuration.
      vertx.deployVerticle(MarketDataVerticle.class.getName(),
         new DeploymentOptions().setConfig(company));
    }

    vertx.deployVerticle(RestQuoteAPIVerticle.class.getName());

    publishMessageSource("market-data", ADDRESS, rec -> {
      if (!rec.succeeded()) {
        rec.cause().printStackTrace();
      }
      System.out.println("Market-Data service published : " + rec.succeeded());
    });

    publishHttpEndpoint("quotes", "localhost", config().getInteger("http.port", 8080), ar -> {
      if (ar.failed()) {
        ar.cause().printStackTrace();
      } else {
        System.out.println("Quotes (Rest endpoint) service published : " + ar.succeeded());
      }
    });
}
----

Verticles can retrieve a configuration using the `config()` method. Here it gets the details about the companies to
simulate. The configuration is a `JsonObject`. Vert.x heavily uses JSON, so you are going to see a lot of JSON in
this lab. For each company found in the configuration, it deploys another verticle with the extracted configuration.
Finally, it deploys another verticle providing a very simple HTTP API.

The last part of the method is about the service discovery mentioned in the microservice section. This component
generates quotes sent on the event bus. But to let other components discover where the messages are sent (_where_
means on which address), it registers it. `market-data` is the name of the service, `ADDRESS` is the event bus
address on which the messages are sent. The last argument is a `Handler` that is notified when the registration has
been completed. The `handler` receives a structure called `AsyncResult`.

Remember, Vert.x is promoting an asynchronous, non-blocking development model. Publishing the service may take time
(actually it does as it creates a record, write it to the backend, and notifies everyone), as we cannot block the
 event loop, the method is asynchronous. Asynchronous methods have a `Handler` as last parameter that is invoked when
 the operation has been completed. This `Handler` is called with the same event loop as the one having called the async
 method. As the asynchronous operation can fail, the `Handler` receives as parameter an `AsyncResult` telling
 whether or not the operation has succeeded. You will see the following patterns a lot in Vert.x applications:

[source, java]
----
 // Asynchronous method returning an object of type X
 operation(param1, param2, Handler<AsyncResult<X>>);

 // Handler receiving an object of type X

 ar -> {
   if (ar.succeeded()) {
      X x = ar.result();
      // Do something with X
   } else {
      // it failed
      Throwable cause = ar.cause();
   }
 }
----

If you remember the architecture, the quote generator also provides a HTTP endpoint returning the last values of the
quotes (but, you are going to work on it). As the previous service, it needs to be published. For the publication it
gives details on its locations (host, port...):

[source, java]
----
publishHttpEndpoint("quotes", "localhost", config().getInteger("http.port", 8080), ar -> {
  if (ar.failed()) {
    ar.cause().printStackTrace();
  } else {
    System.out.println("Quotes (Rest endpoint) service published : " + ar.succeeded());
  }
});
----

### The quote REST endpoint

It's time for you to develop some parts of the application (I know you have pins and needles in your fingers). Open the
`RestQuoteAPIVerticle`. It's a verticle class extending `AbstractVerticle`. In the `start` method you need to:

1. Register an event bus consumer to collect the last quotations (in the `quotes` map)
2. Handle HTTP requests to return the list of quotes, or a single quote if the `name` (query) param is set.

Let's do that....

#### Task - Implementing a Handler to receive events

The first action is about creating a `Handler`, so a method that is invoked on event. Handlers are an important part of Vert.x, so it's important to understand what they are.

In this task, the `Handler` is going to be called for each message sent on the event bus on a specific `address` (receiving each quote sent by the generator). It's a _message consumer_. The `message` parameter is the received message.

Implement the logic that retrieve the body of the message (with the `body()` method. Then extract from the body the `name` of the quote and add an entry `name -> quote` in the `quotes` map.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
JsonObject quote = message.body(); // 1
quotes.put(quote.getString("name"), quote); // 2
----

First, it retrieves the message body (1). It's a JSON object, and stores it in the `quotes` map (2).
****

#### Task - Implementing a Handler to handle HTTP requests

Now that you did a first `Handler`, let's do a second one. This handler does not receive messages from the event bus, but HTTP requests. The handler is attached to a HTTP server and is called every time there is a HTTP request to the server, the handler is called and is responsible for writing the response.

To handle the HTTP requests, we need a HTTP server. Fortunately, Vert.x lets you create HTTP servers using:

[source, java]
----
vertx.createHttpServer()
    .requestHandler(request -> {...})
    .listen(port, resultHandler);
----

Write the content of the request handler to respond to the request:

1. a response with the `content-type` header set to `application/json`
2. retrieve the `name` parameter (it's the company name)
3. if the company name is not set, return all the quotes as json.
4. if the company name is set, return the stored quote or a 404 response if the company is unknown

TIP: The response to a request is accessible using `request.response()`

TIP: To write the response use `response.end(content)`.

TIP: To create the JSON representation of an object, you can use the `Json.encode` method

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
HttpServerResponse response = request.response()    // <1>
    .putHeader("content-type", "application/json");
String company = request.getParam("name");          // <2>
if (company == null) {
    String content = Json.encodePrettily(quotes);   // <3>
    response
        .end(content);                              // <4>
 } else {
    JsonObject quote = quotes.get(company);
    if (quote == null) {
      response.setStatusCode(404).end();            // <5>
    } else {
      response.end(quote.encodePrettily());
    }
 }
----
<1> Get the `response` object from the `request`
<2> Gets the `name` parameter (query parameter)
<3> Encode the map to JSON
<4> Write the response and flush it using `end(...)`
<5> If the given name does not match a company, set the status code to `404`
****

You may wonder why synchronization is not required. Indeed we write in the map and read from it without any
synchronization constructs. Here is one of the main feature of Vert.x: all this code is going to be executed by
the **same** event loop, so it's always accessed by the **same** thread, never concurrently.

TIP: The `Map<String, JsonObject>` could be replaced by a simple `JsonObject` as they behave as a `Map<String, Object>`.

### Time to start the quote generator

First, let's build the microservice _fat-jar_. In the terminal, execute:

----
cd quote-generator
mvn package
----

Then, open a new terminal and launch:

----
java -jar target/quote-generator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
----

This command launches the application. The main class we used creates a clustered Vert.x instance and reads the
configuration from `src/conf/config.json`. This configuration provides the HTTP port on which the REST service is
published (`35000`).

Let's now open a browser and have a look to http://localhost:35000.

It should return something like:

----
{
  "MacroHard" : {
    "volume" : 100000,
    "shares" : 51351,
    "symbol" : "MCH",
    "name" : "MacroHard",
    "ask" : 655.0,
    "bid" : 666.0,
    "open" : 600.0
  },
  "Black Coat" : {
    "volume" : 90000,
    "shares" : 45889,
    "symbol" : "BCT",
    "name" : "Black Coat",
    "ask" : 654.0,
    "bid" : 641.0,
    "open" : 300.0
  },
  "Divinator" : {
    "volume" : 500000,
    "shares" : 251415,
    "symbol" : "DVN",
    "name" : "Divinator",
    "ask" : 877.0,
    "bid" : 868.0,
    "open" : 800.0
  }
}
----

It gives the current details of each quotes. The data is updated every 3 seconds, so refresh your browser to get
the latest data.

Let's now launch the dashboard. In another terminal, navigate to `$project-home/trader-dashboard` and execute:

[source]
----
mvn clean package
java -jar target/trader-dashboard-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
----

Then, open your browser to http://localhost:8080. You should see:

image::dashboard-initial-state.png[Dashboard, 800]

Some parts have no _content_, and it's expected as it's just the beginning...

### You are not a financial expert ?

So maybe you are not used to the financial world and words... Neither am I, and this is a overly simplified version.
Let's define the important fields:

* `name` : the company name
* `symbol` : short name
* `shares` : the number of stock that can be bought
* `open` : the stock price when the session opened
* `ask` : the price of the stock when you buy them (seller price)
* `bid` : the price of the stock when you sell them (buyer price)
