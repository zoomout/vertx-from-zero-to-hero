## The Audit service

The law is the law... The _Sarbanesâ€“Oxley Act_ requires you to keep a track of every transaction you do on a
 financial market. The audit service records the shares you buy and sell in a database. It's going to be a HSQL
 database, but is would be similar with another database, even no-sql database.

### Accessing data asynchronously

As said previously, Vert.x is asynchronous and you must never block the event loop. And you know what's definitely
blocking ? Database accesses and more particularly JDBC! Fortunately, Vert.x provides a JDBC client that is asynchronous.

The principle is simple (and is applied to all clients accessing blocking systems):

[plantuml, database-sequence, png]
----
@startuml
autonumber
participant Application
participant Handler
participant Client
control Worker
database Database

Application -> Client : The application send the query, instruction,\n statement to the client; with a Handler
Client -> Worker : The client enqueue in a Worker the task to be done
Client -> Application : The client returns immediately
Worker -> Database : The worker executes the task on the database
Worker -> Client : When done, the worker notify the client
Client -> Handler : The client invokes the handler \n(in the same thread as the interaction (1))\n with the operation result.

@enduml
----

NOTE: _Worker_ ? Yes, Vert.x has the notion of _workers_ (a separated thread pool) to execute blocking code. It can be a
 verticle marked as _worker_ or with the `vertx.executeBlocking` construct. However, even if possible, you should not
 abuse from these features as it reduces the scalability of the application.

However, interactions with databases are rarely a single operation, but a composition of operations. For example:

1. Get a connection
2. Drop some tables
3. Create some tables
4. Close the connection

So, we need a way to compose these operations, and report failures when required. This is what we are going to see
in the Audit component.

### The Audit service

The Audit service:

1. Listens for the financial operations on the event bus
2. Stores the received operations in a database
3. Exposes a REST API to get the last 10 operations

Interactions with the database use the `vertx-jdbc-client`, an async version of JDBC. So expect to see some SQL code
(I know you love it).


### Rxjava

#### Intro

Vert.x uses a simple callback based asynchrony and its `Future` object is an helper tool useful for callback
coordination. RxJava implements the Reactive Extensions for the JVM and is a library for composing asynchronous and
event-based programs.

With RxJava, you model your code around data flow (called `Observable`). These data flow are pipes in which data
transits. These `Observable` can represent finite or infinite streams, but also streams with a single element. When
a stream is known to hold exactly one element, it is convenient to use the `Single` type. Finally a `Completable`
represents a stream with no elements, i.e it can only complete without a value or fail.

To use such reactive type, a _subscription_ operation is necessary.

[source, java]
----
Observable<String> observable = getStringObservable();

// Subscribe to the stream
observable.subscribe(item -> {
  // Received a String item
  }, error -> {
  // Error termination => no more items
  }, () -> {
  // Normal termination => no more items
  });
----

Singles are simpler to work with as they hold exactly one element, they have some similarities with future/promises
although they have noticeable differences:

- a future/promise is the result of an asynchronous operation, e.g, you start a server and you get a promise of the server bind result
- a single result usually has a side effect at subscription time, e.g you subscribe to the single, as side effect it start the server
and the single notifies you of the bind result

[source, java]
----
Single<String> single = getStringSingle();

// Subscribe to the single
single.subscribe(item -> {
  // Completion with the string item
  }, error -> {
  // Completion with an error
  });
----

#### Composition and transformation

RxJava provides a very useful set of operators for composing and transforming asynchronous flows.

We will use the main ones in this lab : `map`, `flatMap` and `zip`.

The `map` operator transforms synchronously the result of an operation.

[source, java]
----
// Transform the stream of strings into a stream of Buffer
Observable<Buffer> observable = getStringObservable().map(s -> vertx.fileSystem().readFileBlocking(s));

// Transform the string single into a Buffer single
Single<Buffer> single = getStringSingle().map(s -> vertx.fileSystem().readFileBlocking(s));
----

The drawback of the `map` operator is the imposed synchrony, in order to retrieve the content of a file we have
to use the _blocking_ version of the filesystem, and thus we break the Vert.x golden rule!

Fortunately there is an asynchronous version called `flatMap`.

[source, java]
----
// Transform the stream of strings into a stream of Buffer
Observable<Buffer> observable = getStringObservable().flatMap(s -> {
  Single<Buffer> single = vertx.fileSystem().rxReadFile();
  return single.toObservable();
});

// Transform the string single into a Buffer single
Single<Buffer> single = getStringSingle().flatMap(s -> {
  Single<Buffer> single = vertx.fileSystem().rxReadFile();
  return single;
});
----

The `zip` operator combines the results of several `Observable`/`Single` in a single result, let's see with `Single`:

[source, java]
----
Single<String> single1 = getStringSingle();
Single<String> single2 = getStringSingle();
Single<String> single3 = getStringSingle();

Single<String> combinedSingle = Single.zip(single1, single2, single3, (s1,s2,s3) -> s1 + s2 + s3);

combinedSingle.subscribe(s -> {
  // Got the three concatenated strings
}, error -> {
  // At least one of single1, single2 or single3 failed
});

----

It works similarly for `Observable`, but for the sake of the conciseness we will not study it here.

### Vert.x Rx

Vert.x has an Rx version of its asynchronous API packaged with the `io.vertx.*rxjava*` prefix, e.g `io.vertx.*rxjava*.core.Vertx`
 is the Rx version of `io.vertx.core.Vertx`. The _rxified_ version of Vert.x exposes the asynchronous methods as
 `Single` and the stream types as `Observable`.

#### Vert.x streams

The type `ReadStream<T>` models a reactive sequence of `T` items, for instance an `HttpServerRequest` is a `ReadStream<Buffer>`.

The _rxified_ version exposes a `toObservable()` method to turn the stream into an `Observable<T>`:

[source, java]
----
import io.vertx.rxjva.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.rxjva.core.http.HttpServer;

...

Vertx vertx = Vert.vertx();
HttpServer server = vertx.createHttpServer();
server.requestHandler(request -> {
  if (request.path().equals("/upload")) {
    Observable<Buffer> observable = request.toObservable();
    observable.subscribe(buffer -> {
      // Got an uploaded buffer
      }, error -> {
      // Got an error => no more buffers
      }, () -> {
      // Done => no more buffers
    });
  }
});
----

In this section, we will not use `Observable` as we don't focus much on reactive streams. However we will discover and
use `Single`.

#### Vert.x singles

Each asynchronous method, i.e a method having a last parameter `Handler<AsyncResult<T>>`, has an _rxified_ version, named
 after the original method name prefixe by `rx`, with the same parameters minus the last and returning a `Single` of the
 asynchronous type.

Unlike the original method, calling the _rx_ version does not make an actual call. Instead you get a single that will
call the actual method at subscription time.

[source, java]
----
import io.vertx.rxjva.core.Vertx;
import io.vertx.rxjva.core.http.HttpServer;

...

Vertx vertx = Vert.vertx();
HttpServer server = vertx.createHttpServer();
server.requestHandler(request -> ...);

// The single has been created but the server is actually not starting at this point
Single<HttpServer> listenSingle = server.rxListen(8080);

// Triggers the actual start
listenSingle.subscribe(
  server -> {
    // The server is started and bound on 8080
  }, error -> {
    // The server could not start
  });
----

### Task - Composing methods returning Single.

Open the `io.vertx.workshop.audit.impl.AuditVerticle` class. The first important detail of this verticle is its
`start` method. As the `start` method from the Java trader, the method is asynchronous, and report its completion in the
 given `Future` object:

[source, java]
----
  public void start(Future<Void> future) {
    super.start();

    // creates the jdbc client.
    jdbc = JDBCClient.createNonShared(vertx, config());

    // TODO
    // ----
    Single<MessageConsumer<JsonObject>> ready = Single.error(new UnsupportedOperationException("not yet implemented"));
    // ----

    readySingle.doOnSuccess(consumer -> {
      // on success we set the handler that will store message in the database
      consumer.handler(message -> storeInDatabase(message.body()));
    }).subscribe(consumer -> {
      // complete the verticle start with a success
      future.complete();
    }, error -> {
      // signal a verticle start failure
      future.fail(error);
    });
  }
----

Vert.x would consider the verticle deploy when the `Future` is valuated. It may also report a failure if the verticle
 cannot be started correctly.

Initializing the audit service includes:

* prepare the database (table)
* start the HTTP service and expose the REST API. In addition publish this endpoint as a service
* retrieve the message source on which the operation are sent

So, it's clearly 3 independent actions, but the audit service is started only when all of them has been completed.

Replace the `TODO` block with some code. This code should retrieves 3 single objects (from methods provided in the class)
and _wait_ for the completion of the three tasks. The three singles should be combined in one `Single<MessageConsumer<JsonObject>>`.

On success this single registers a message listener on the portfolio message source  storing the operation in the database
for each received message.

Its completion notifies Vert.x that the start process is completed (or successfully or not), it calls `future.complete()` and
`future.fail(cause)`.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
    Single<Void> databaseReady = initializeDatabase(config().getBoolean("drop", false));
    Single<Void> httpEndpointReady = configureTheHTTPServer()
        .flatMap(server -> rxPublishHttpEndpoint("audit", "localhost", server.actualPort()));
    Single<MessageConsumer<JsonObject>> messageConsumerReady = retrieveThePortfolioMessageSource();
    Single<MessageConsumer<JsonObject>> readySingle = Single.zip(
        databaseReady,
        httpEndpointReady,
        messageConsumerReady,
        (db, http, consumer) -> consumer);
----

First we create 3 `Single`, one per action to execute. We are going to see how they are created in a minute. Then we
compose all of them using the `Single.zip` operator. The zip function returns the consumer single as this is the
one we really care about.
****

### Task - Implementing a method returning a Single

Now our verticle extends the `RxMicroServiceVerticle` base class, this class provides the same helper method
  than `MicroServiceVerticle` using Rx singles.

We have mentioned that async method have a signature with a `Handler` as last parameter. There is an equivalent syntax
that returns a `Single` object when the operations they are executing are completed:

[source, java]
----
void asyncMethod(a, b, Handler<AsyncResult<R>> handler);
// is equivalent to
Single<R> asyncMethod(a, b);
----

Indeed, the caller can subscribe on the returned `Single` object to execute the async operation and be notified when
the operation has completed or failed

[source, java]
----
Single<R> single = asyncMethod(a, b);
single.subscribe(r  -> {
    // Do something with the result
  }, err -> {
    // the operation has failed
  });
----

Let's implement the `configureTheHTTPServer` method following this pattern. In this method we are going to use a new Vert.x
Component: Vert.x Web. Vert.x Web is a Vert.x extension to build modern web application. Here we are going to use
a `Router` which let us implement _REST_ APIs easily (_Ã  la_ Hapi or ExpressJS). So:

1. Create a `Router` object with: `Router.router(vertx)`
2. Register a route (on `/`) on the router, calling `retrieveOperations`
3. Create a HTTP server delegating the request handler to `router.accept`.
4. Retrieve the port passed in the configuration or `0` if not set (it picks an available port), we can pick
    a random port as it is exposed in the service record, so consumer are bound to the right port.
5. Start the server with the `rxListen` version of the listen method that returns a single.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
private Single<HttpServer> configureTheHTTPServer() {
    // Use a Vert.x Web router for this REST API.
    Router router = Router.router(vertx);
    router.get("/").handler(this::retrieveOperations);

    return vertx.createHttpServer()
        .requestHandler(router::accept)
        .rxListen(config().getInteger("http.port", 0));
}
----

It creates a `Router`. The `Router` is an object from http://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/[Vert.x web] that ease the
creation of REST API with Vert.x. We won't go into too much details here, but if you want to implement REST API with
Vert.x, this is the way to go. On our `Router` we declare a _route_: when a request arrive on `/`, it calls this `Handler`.
Then, we create the HTTP server. The `requestHandler` is a specific method of the `router`, and we  return the result
of the `rxListen` method.
****

So, the caller can call this method and get a `Single`. It can subscribe on it to bind the server and be notified
of the completion of the operation (or failure).

If you look at the `retrieveThePortfolioMessageSource`, you would see the very same pattern.

### Using Async JDBC

In the `start` method, we are calling `initializeDatabase`. Let's look at this method using another type of action
composition. This method:

* get a connection to the database
* drop the table
* create the table
* close the connection (whatever the result of the two last operations)

All these operations may fail.

In the last paragraph we have seen methods returning `Single`. `Chains` are a composition of such functions:

1. you have an input
2. you execute a first `Function` taking the input from (1) and returning a `Single`
3. you execute a second `Function` taking the input from (2) and returning a `Single`
4. ....

The completion of a chain is a `Single` object. If one of the chained operation fails, this `Single` is marked as
failed, otherwise it is completed with the result of the last operation:

[source, code]
----
Single<X> chain = input.flatMap(function1).flatMap(function2).flatMap(function3);
----

So to use the composition pattern, we just need a set of `Functions` and a `Single` that would trigger the chain.
Let's create this `Single` first:

[source, java]
----
// This is the starting point of our Rx operations
// This single will be completed when the connection with the database is established.
// We are going to use this single as a reference on the connection to close it.
Single<SQLConnection> connectionRetrieved = jdbc.rxGetConnection();
----

Then, we need compose the single with the `flatMap` method that is taking a `SQLConnection` as parameter and returns
a single that contains the result of the database initialization.

1. we create the batch to execute
2. the `rxBatch` executes the batch gives us the single returns of the operation
3. finally we close the connection with `doAfterTerminate`

[source,java]
----
Single<List<Integer>> resultSingle = connectionRetrieved
  .flatMap(conn -> {
    // When the connection is retrieved

    // Prepare the batch
    List<String> batch = new ArrayList<>();
    if (drop) {
      // When the table is dropped, we recreate it
      batch.add(DROP_STATEMENT);
    }
    // Just create the table
    batch.add(CREATE_TABLE_STATEMENT);

    // We compose with a statement batch
    Single<List<Integer>> next = conn.rxBatch(batch);

    // Whatever the result, if the connection has been retrieved, close it
    return next.doAfterTerminate(conn::close);
  });
----

The `resultSingle` is the final result providing a `Single<List<Integer>>` but we will return only a `Single<Void>`
 as the caller only cares about the global result and not the detail.

This is simple achieved with the `map` operations on the single:

[source,java]
----
return resultSingle.<Void>map(null);
----

And voilÃ !

### Task - Async JDBC with a callback-based composition

You may ask why we do such kind of composition. Let's implement a method without any composition operator (just using
 callbacks). The `retrieveOperations` method is called when a HTTP request arrives and should return a JSON object
 containing the last 10 operations. So, in other words:

1. Get a connection to the database
2. Query the database
3. Iterate over the result to get the list
4. Write the list in the HTTP response
5. Close the database

The step (1) and (2) are asynchronous. (5) is asynchronous too, but we don't have to wait for the completion. In this
 code, don't use composition (that's the purpose of this exercise). In `retrieveOperations`, write the required code using _Handlers_ / _Callbacks_.

[.assignment]
****
[source, java]
----
// 1 - we retrieve the connection
jdbc.getConnection(ar -> {
  SQLConnection connection = ar.result();
  if (ar.failed()) {
    context.fail(ar.cause());
  } else {
    // 2. we execute the query
    connection.query(SELECT_STATEMENT, result -> {
      ResultSet set = result.result();

      // 3. Build the list of operations
      List<JsonObject> operations = set.getRows().stream()
          .map(json -> new JsonObject(json.getString("OPERATION")))
          .collect(Collectors.toList());

      // 4. Send the list to the response
      context.response().setStatusCode(200).end(Json.encodePrettily(operations));

      // 5. Close the connection
      connection.close();
    });
  }
});
----
****

So obviously it's possible too not use composition. But imagine when you have several asynchronous operation to
chain, it become a callback hell very quickly. So, as a recommendation: use the Vert.x composition operators or use
the _rxified_ version of Vert.x API.

### Show time !

Let's see how this works.

First you need to built it:

[source]
----
cd audit-service
mvn clean package
----

Then, you need to launch the application:

[source]
----
 java -jar target/audit-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT-fat.jar
----

Restart and refresh the dashboard, and you should see the operations in the top right corner!
