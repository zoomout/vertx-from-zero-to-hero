## Prerequisites

We will get to the good stuff, coding all the way soon... But before we start, we need to install a couple of software on our machine.

### Hardware

* Operating System: Mac OS X (10.8+), Windows 7+, Ubuntu 12+, CentOS 7+, Fedora 22+
* Memory: At least 4 GB+, preferred 8 GB

### Java Development Kit

We need a JDK 8+ installed on our machine. Latest JDK can downloaded from:

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[Oracle JDK 8]

You can use either Oracle JDK or OpenJDK.

### Maven

* Download Apache Maven from https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi.
* Unzip to a directory of your choice and add it to the `PATH`.

### IDE

We recommend you to use an IDE. You can use Eclipse, IntelliJ or Netbeans.

#### No IDE ?

If you don't have an IDE, here are the step to get started with Eclipse.

1. First download Eclipse from https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[the download page].
2. In the _Eclipse Package_ list, select _Eclipse IDE for Java Developers_. It brings you to a download page with a
`Download` button.
3. Once downloaded, unzip it.
4. In the destination directory, you should find an `Eclipse` binary that you can execute.
5. Eclipse asks you to create a workspace.
6. Once launched, click on the _Workbench_ arrow (top right corner).
