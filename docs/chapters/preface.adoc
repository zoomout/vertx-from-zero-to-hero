## Preface

Let's start from the beginning.... _Vert.x_. What's Vert.x? That's a pretty good question, and probably a good start.
 If you go on the http://vertx.io[Vert.x web site], Vert.x is defined as _"a toolkit for building reactive
 applications on the JVM"_. This description is rather unclear, right? What's a _toolkit_? What are _reactive_
 applications? In this lab, we are going to explain these words, and build an application using Vert.x illustrating
 what Vert.x is. This application is going to be composed of _microservices_. Another buzzword that is currently trending, right ? Actually,
 Vert.x was already promoting _microservices_  before anyone else.

The developed application is going to be:

* based on Vert.x (that's why you are here, right?)
* distributed
* built as a reactive system
* (a bit) fun

This lab offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Vert.x, from the first line of code, to making
services, to consuming them and finally to assembling everything in a consistent reactive system. It illustrates what reactive systems are, what reactive programming is, and how to build applications based on reactive microservice**s**
(and the **s** is important).

This is a BYOL (Bring Your Own Laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop. You need JDK 8+ on your
machine, and Apache Maven (3.3+).

What you are going to learn:

* What Vert.x is and how to use its asynchronous non-blocking development model
* How to develop microservices with Vert.x with several types of services, and service discovery
* What `verticles` are and how to use them 
* How to use the Vert.x event bus to send and receive messages
* How to expose HTTP endpoints with Vert.x, and also how to consume them
* How to compose asynchronous actions
* How to use several languages in the same application
* How to use databases with Vert.x
* How to manage failures with async results, futures, exception handlers and circuit breakers
* How to use Vert.x with RxJava

And many more...
